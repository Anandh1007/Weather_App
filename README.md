#DESCRIPTION :
 Weather App â€“ Responsive Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a responsive and interactive Weather Application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for any city using the WeatherAPI service. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app offers a clean, user-friendly interface and dynamically updates weather information based on user input.

ðŸ”§ Features:
City Search: Users can enter the name of any city worldwide to get the current weather.

Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches live weather details such as temperature, condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity, wind speed, and a representative icon.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout ensures compatibility across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Error Handling: Displays a helpful message if the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API.

Dynamic Weather Icons: Automatically shows weather condition icons fetched from the API.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structure and layout of the web page.

CSS3: Styling and responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries.

JavaScript (Vanilla): For DOM manipulation, API requests, and dynamic content rendering.

WeatherAPI: Provides real-time weather data in JSON format.

How It Works:
The user enters a city name into the input field.

When the "Get Weather" button is clicked, a JavaScript function is triggered.

The app sends a GET request to the WeatherAPI endpoint using fetch().

On receiving the response, the app parses the JSON data and displays:

City & Country

Temperature (in Celsius)

Weather Condition

Humidity

Wind Speed

Weather Icon

If the city is invalid or the API fails, an error message is displayed.
